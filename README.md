# python-toolbox
Functions - integrations - classes, etc. Whatever I think is useful will be thrown here

This is my personal stash of Python utilities.  
No structure rules, no philosophy â€” just code I might need later.

## Install

Just clone or copy/paste what you need. No pip package (yet?)
git clone https://github.com/mauriciomolinapicco/python-toolbox.git

If it saved me time once, it lands here.
